                    I’m Joseph, a software developer building human-centered software that solve real problems and scale gracefully. I work with React, React Native and related technologies, focusing on clean architecture, backend-driven systems and maintainable code that grows with the product. I’m driven by turning ideas into functional platforms that serve communities and organizations effectively.
